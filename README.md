# heart-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning

The paper demonstrated many Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, Naive bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Grid Search CV, SVM for predicting the heart disease using Erbil heart disease dataset from kaggle having 22 different medical and non-medical attributes. The precision, accuracy, F1-score, and recall of all algorithms used for predicting the heart disease is evaluated. Decision Tree Classifier algorithm provided a good accuracy of 98% among all other algorithms.
